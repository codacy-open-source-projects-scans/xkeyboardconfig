      Hi. Thanks for filing this issue/merge request. We think this keyboard layout is too exotic
      to be shipped as part of the default xkeyboard-config keymaps. Layouts added to
      the distribution means we have to maintain these layouts for years and decades into
      the future and we avoid having to do so for layouts that we expect have a tiny number of
      users.

      As a general rule, we will add layouts that are part of official standards but not
      experimental layouts. If this is the case here, please re-open with a comment.

      Please install it as a custom layout instead, we have
      [instructions for Xorg](https://who-t.blogspot.com/2021/02/a-pre-supplied-custom-keyboard-layout.html)
      and [instructions for Wayland](https://xkbcommon.github.io/libxkbcommon/doc/current/md_doc_user_configuration.html).
    status: "close"
